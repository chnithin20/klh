  "thermodynamics": "Great question! Thermodynamics trips up most JEE students because there are too many formulas without understanding the WHY.\n\n🔑 Key insight: Think of the 3 laws as:\n• 0th Law = Thermometers work\n• 1st Law = Energy is conserved (ΔU = Q - W)\n• 2nd Law = Heat flows hot → cold, never reverse\n\n📌 For Carnot cycle, just remember: Efficiency η = 1 - (T_cold/T_hot). The temperatures MUST be in Kelvin!\n\n💡 Practice tip: Don't memorize PV diagrams — draw them yourself from scratch each time. That's what actually builds memory.",
  "carnot": "The Carnot cycle in plain English:\n\n1️⃣ Isothermal Expansion (A→B): Gas absorbs heat Q₁ at constant temp T₁. Does work.\n2️⃣ Adiabatic Expansion (B→C): No heat exchange. Temp drops to T₂.\n3️⃣ Isothermal Compression (C→D): Gas releases heat Q₂ at temp T₂.\n4️⃣ Adiabatic Compression (D→A): Returns to start.\n\n✅ Efficiency = 1 - Q₂/Q₁ = 1 - T₂/T₁\n\nMemory trick: 'Hot gas expands, cold gas compresses' — the cycle just alternates between these two ideas!",
  "organic": "Organic Chemistry has a reputation for needing memorization — but there's a smarter way! 🧪\n\n🔑 Learn REACTIONS BY MECHANISM, not by rote:\n• SN2 = backside attack, inversion, strong nucleophile, primary carbon\n• SN1 = carbocation forms, retention/racemization, tertiary carbon\n• E1/E2 = same conditions as SN, but base is bulky\n\n📌 Top 5 named reactions for JEE:\n1. Aldol Condensation\n2. Cannizzaro\n3. Clemmensen\n4. Wolff-Kishner\n5. Reimer-Tiemann\n\n💡 Trick: Draw the mechanism every time, even for revision. Your hand remembers what your brain forgets!",
  "hours": "Based on your analysis, here's my recommendation:\n\n📅 Weekdays: 4-5 hours focused study\n• 2 hrs morning (weak topics — peak focus time)\n• 1.5 hrs evening (practice MCQs)\n• 30 min night (review notes only)\n\n📅 Weekends: 6-7 hours\n• Saturday: Full-length mock test (3 hrs) + review\n• Sunday: Weak topic revision + AI coach session\n\n⚠️ Important: Quality > Quantity. 4 focused hours beats 8 distracted hours. Phone in another room during study sessions!",
  "practice": "Here are 3 practice questions on your weakest topic (Thermodynamics):\n\n❓ Q1: An ideal gas undergoes a Carnot cycle between 500K and 300K. What is its efficiency?\nHint: η = 1 - T_cold/T_hot = 1 - 300/500 = ?\n\n❓ Q2: For an adiabatic process, which thermodynamic quantity remains constant?\n(A) Temperature (B) Pressure (C) Heat (D) Volume\n\n❓ Q3: In the first law ΔU = Q - W, if 100J of heat is added to a gas that does 40J of work, what is the change in internal energy?\n\nType your answers and I'll check them! 📝",
  "default": "That's a great question! Based on your mock test analysis, I'd focus on your current weak topics first. Here's my advice:\n\n🎯 Prioritize understanding over memorization — for JEE/NEET, concepts matter more than formulas.\n\n📚 Use the 3-read method:\n1. First read: Just understand, don't take notes\n2. Second read: Note key formulas only\n3. Third read: Solve 5 problems before moving on\n\nWhat specific topic would you like me to explain? I know your weak areas from your mock test! 💪"
